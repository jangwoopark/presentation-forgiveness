## fMRI stimuli for forgiveness

- There is an instructional run for practicing the stimili before running the program within the fMRI machine. 
- It includes the trust game, dictator game, and the ultimatum game.
- Github suggests to use Scilab for this program, but it was written in Presentation based on C++ found at: http://www.neurobs.com/
- A joystick was used to test the reponsiveness for the stimuli. Please test the device when running the programs.
